  // NOTION
  // ============================================
  "notion": [
    {
      question: "Is Notion free?",
      answer: "Yes! Notion's free plan is actually quite generous - you get unlimited pages and blocks for personal use, which is enough for most individuals. The main limitations are 5MB file uploads and only 7 days of page history. If you're working with a team, paid plans start at $10/user/month."
    },
    {
      question: "What's Notion's pricing like?",
      answer: "Pretty straightforward: Plus is $10/user/month for small teams, Business jumps to $18/user/month and adds SAML SSO and admin features. Enterprise pricing varies. Pro tip: students and educators get the Plus plan for free, and annual billing saves you 20%."
    },
    {
      question: "What apps does Notion connect with?",
      answer: "Notion plays nice with over 100 tools - Slack, Google Drive, GitHub, Figma, you name it. The public API means developers can build custom integrations too. Plus you can embed content from YouTube, Miro, Figma directly into pages, which is super handy."
    },
    {
      question: "What can Notion AI do?",
      answer: "Notion AI is like having a writing assistant built right into your workspace. It can draft content, summarize long documents, translate text, brainstorm ideas, and even generate meeting notes. It costs an extra $10/user/month but can be a real time-saver."
    },
    {
      question: "Does Notion work offline?",
      answer: "Sort of. You can view pages you've recently opened, but you'll need internet to actually edit anything. If offline work is important for you, your best bet is exporting pages as Markdown or PDF before going offline."
    },
    {
      question: "Can developers integrate with Notion?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Notion has a full REST API that lets you read, create, update, and delete pages, databases, and blocks. It's well-documented and there's a solid developer community. Great for automating workflows or building custom tools on top of Notion."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Notion good for managing projects?",
      answer: "It's actually excellent for project management - databases, Kanban boards, timelines, calendars, you can set it up however you like. The flexibility is both its strength and weakness: it can do almost anything, but you might spend time configuring it compared to purpose-built PM tools like Linear or Asana."
    }
  ],

  // ============================================
  // SLACK
  // ============================================
  "slack": [
    {
      question: "Is Slack free?",
      answer: "Yep! The free plan is pretty usable - you get 90 days of message history and 10 app integrations. The big catch is losing older messages after 90 days, which can be frustrating. Paid plans ($8.75/user/month) remove that limit and unlock group video calls."
    },
    {
      question: "What does Slack cost?",
      answer: "Pro is $8.75/user/month with unlimited history and group calls. Business+ at $15/user/month adds compliance features and SSO - important for regulated industries. Enterprise Grid is priced per org for large companies. Annual billing knocks off about 15%."
    },
    {
      question: "What tools does Slack integrate with?",
      answer: "Over 2,600 apps - basically everything. Google Workspace, Salesforce, Jira, GitHub, Notion, Zoom... you name it. The API is also excellent, which is why so many companies build Slack-first integrations. That app ecosystem is honestly one of Slack's biggest strengths."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you do video calls in Slack?",
      answer: "Yes! They're called Huddles and they're great for quick conversations. Just click and you're in a call - way faster than scheduling a Zoom. Free users can do 1:1 calls; paid plans get group calls up to 50 people with screen sharing."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Slack good on mobile?",
      answer: "The mobile apps are solid - iOS and Android both work well. You can do pretty much everything: messages, calls, manage notifications. The experience isn't quite as nice as desktop, but it does the job when you're away from your computer."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Slack secure enough for enterprises?",
      answer: "Enterprise Grid is built for this - SAML SSO, data loss prevention, eDiscovery, HIPAA compliance, even FedRAMP authorization. It's why you see banks and healthcare companies using Slack. Not cheap, but the security features are comprehensive."
    },
    {
      question: "Slack vs Teams - which is better?",
      answer: "It depends on your company. Slack has a better user experience and way more integrations. Teams is basically free if you already pay for Microsoft 365, which is hard to beat. Startups and tech companies usually prefer Slack; Microsoft shops gravitate to Teams."
    }
  ],

  // ============================================
  // FIGMA
  // ============================================
  "figma": [
    {
      question: "Is Figma free?",
      answer: "For individuals, yes! The free Starter plan gives you 3 Figma files and 3 FigJam files - enough to work on personal projects. Viewers are always free, which is huge for sharing designs with clients. Teams need Professional at $15/editor/month for unlimited files."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does Figma cost?",
      answer: "Professional is $15/editor/month - that's what most teams use. Organization ($45/editor/month) adds branching, design system analytics, and SSO. Remember, only editors pay - viewers and commenters are free, which makes stakeholder collaboration easy."
    },
    {
      question: "Why choose Figma over Sketch?",
      answer: "The big difference: Figma runs in your browser, so it works on Mac, Windows, or Linux. Real-time collaboration is built in - multiple designers can edit simultaneously. Plus, viewers don't need to buy anything. Sketch is Mac-only and more siloed."
    },
    {
      question: "Can Figma work offline?",
      answer: "The desktop app has some offline support - you can keep working on files you've opened recently. Changes sync when you're back online. But it's really designed as a cloud tool, so constant connectivity gives you the best experience."
    },
    {
      question: "What's FigJam for?",
      answer: "FigJam is Figma's whiteboard for brainstorming, workshops, and quick diagrams. Sticky notes, arrows, stamps - the usual whiteboard stuff. It's included in all plans and connects nicely with your design files. Great for design sprints and team planning."
    },
    {
      question: "Does Figma have AI tools?",
      answer: "They've been rolling out AI features - auto-layout suggestions, layer renaming, placeholder content generation. It's still evolving, but the direction is clear: AI to handle tedious tasks so designers can focus on actual design decisions."
    },
    {
      question: "How do developers use Figma?",
      answer: "Dev Mode is specifically for devs - inspect designs, grab code snippets (CSS, Swift, Kotlin), see exact specs. It connects to Jira and GitHub too. Designers hand off cleanly, developers get what they need without constant back-and-forth."
    }
  ],

  // ============================================
  // AIRTABLE
  // ============================================
  "airtable": [
    {
      question: "Is Airtable free?",
      answer: "There's a free plan with up to 1,000 records per base and 100 automation runs per month. Works great for small projects or testing things out. Once you hit those limits, Team pricing starts at $20/seat/month."
    },
    {
      question: "What does Airtable cost?",
      answer: "Team is $20/seat/month (25,000 records), Business is $45/seat/month (100,000 records), Enterprise goes even higher. The jump from free to paid can feel steep, but you get way more records and automation runs. Annual billing saves 20%."
    },
    {
      question: "What's Airtable actually good for?",
      answer: "Think of it as a database that looks like a spreadsheet. People build project trackers, CRMs, inventory systems, content calendars - basically any structured data. The magic is in different views: same data, but seen as a grid, kanban, calendar, or timeline."
    },
    {
      question: "What does Airtable connect with?",
      answer: "Native integrations with Slack, Google Workspace, Salesforce, Jira. Plus Zapier and Make connections open up thousands more options. The REST API is solid if you need custom stuff. Airtable Sync is neat for connecting multiple bases together."
    },
    {
      question: "Can Airtable automate things?",
      answer: "Yes! The automations are actually pretty powerful - trigger actions when records change, send emails, update Slack, create records in other tables. Free tier gives you 100 runs/month; paid plans unlock more capacity and advanced triggers."
    },
    {
      question: "How is Airtable different from Google Sheets?",
      answer: "It looks like a spreadsheet but it's really a database. You can link records between tables, attach files, have multiple views of the same data. Sheets is better for calculations and formulas; Airtable is better for organizing structured information."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you build apps on Airtable?",
      answer: "Interface Designer lets you create custom dashboards, forms, and portals - no code needed. Great for making user-friendly views of your data or building simple tools for your team. More capable than you'd expect from a 'spreadsheet tool.'"
    }
  ],

  // ============================================
  // TRELLO
  // ============================================
  "trello": [
    {
      question: "Is Trello free?",
      answer: "The free plan is actually pretty solid - unlimited cards, 10 boards, unlimited storage. Most small teams can get by on free. Paid starts at just $5/user/month if you need unlimited boards, which is one of the cheapest options out there."
    },
    {
      question: "What's Trello's pricing?",
      answer: "Super accessible: Standard is $5/user/month, Premium is $10/user/month and adds timeline and dashboard views. Enterprise is $17.50/user/month for SSO and advanced permissions. Even the premium tiers are cheaper than most competitors."
    },
    {
      question: "What are Power-Ups?",
      answer: "They're add-ons that extend what Trello can do - calendar views, voting, Slack integration, you name it. Used to be limited on free plans, but now you get unlimited Power-Ups on all plans. Lots of the best ones are free."
    },
    {
      question: "Can Trello automate workflows?",
      answer: "Butler is built-in and surprisingly capable. Set up rules like 'when a card moves to Done, mark it complete and notify the channel.' Free gets you 250 commands/month - plenty for most use cases."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Trello enough for project management?",
      answer: "For straightforward task tracking, absolutely. Kanban boards work great for workflows with clear stages. But if you need dependencies, resource planning, or detailed timelines, you'll probably outgrow it and want something like Asana or Linear."
    },
    {
      question: "Does Trello work for enterprises?",
      answer: "There's an Enterprise tier with SSO, org-wide permissions, and priority support. It works, though honestly Trello's strength is simplicity. Big companies often use it alongside more complex tools for specific team workflows."
    },
    {
      question: "Trello vs Asana - which one?",
      answer: "Trello is simpler and more visual - great if Kanban boards fit how you work. Asana has more features: timelines, forms, workload views. Trello for simplicity, Asana for complex project needs. Many teams start with Trello and graduate to Asana."
    }
  ],

  // ============================================
  // ASANA
  // ============================================
  "asana": [
    {
      question: "Is Asana free?",
      answer: "Yes, and the free plan is surprisingly capable - unlimited tasks and projects for up to 10 people. The main things you miss are timeline view and advanced automation. Premium at $10.99/user/month unlocks those."
    },
    {
      question: "What does Asana cost?",
      answer: "Premium is $10.99/user/month for timeline, forms, and automation rules. Business at $24.99/user/month adds portfolios, goals tracking, and workload management. The gap between tiers is significant - most growing teams end up on Business."
    },
    {
      question: "What project views are available?",
      answer: "List, Board (Kanban), Timeline (like a Gantt chart), Calendar, and Dashboard. Same project, different views - switch depending on what you're trying to see. Timeline is probably the most useful paid feature, honestly."
    },
    {
      question: "What apps does Asana integrate with?",
      answer: "Over 200 integrations - Slack, Teams, Google Workspace, Jira, GitHub, Salesforce, the usual suspects. The Zapier and Make integrations extend this massively. API is well-documented if you need custom stuff."
    },
    {
      question: "Can Asana automate workflows?",
      answer: "Rules let you automate the repetitive stuff - auto-assign tasks, move things between sections, send notifications. Premium unlocks the good stuff. Not as flexible as Zapier but good for most standard workflows."
    },
    {
      question: "How does Goals work in Asana?",
      answer: "You set company and team goals, then link them to actual projects and tasks. Progress updates automatically based on project completion. Good for OKR tracking if you want everything in one place instead of using a separate tool."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Asana secure enough for enterprise?",
      answer: "Enterprise tier adds SSO, SCIM provisioning, admin controls, and custom branding. SOC 2 Type II certified, GDPR compliant. Security features are solid for regulated industries, though you'll need the top tier to get them."
    }
  ],

  // ============================================
  // LINEAR
  // ============================================
  "linear": [
    {
      question: "Is Linear free?",
      answer: "Yes, and unlike most tools, the free plan doesn't gate features - you get everything except you're limited to 250 issues. Perfect for small teams. Standard at $8/user/month removes that limit."
    },
    {
      question: "What does Linear cost?",
      answer: "Standard is $8/user/month for unlimited issues. Plus at $14/user/month adds analytics and time tracking. Honestly, $8/user is very competitive for how polished the product is. Enterprise adds SSO and audit logs."
    },
    {
      question: "Why do people love Linear over Jira?",
      answer: "Speed. Linear is fast - like, noticeably fast. The UI is clean and keyboard-driven. It's opinionated in good ways: less configuration, more getting things done. Jira lets you customize everything, but that's also why it gets slow and cluttered."
    },
    {
      question: "What does Linear integrate with?",
      answer: "GitHub and GitLab integration is excellent - PRs automatically link to issues, issues close when PRs merge. Slack, Figma, Sentry, Zendesk are all there. GraphQL API for anything custom. The integrations feel thoughtful, not tacked on."
    },
    {
      question: "How do Linear roadmaps work?",
      answer: "Projects become your roadmap items - set target dates, visualize on a timeline, track progress automatically as issues get done. It's simple but effective. No need for a separate roadmapping tool for most teams."
    },
    {
      question: "What are Cycles in Linear?",
      answer: "Basically sprints, but Linear-flavored. Set them weekly or bi-weekly, drag issues in, and incomplete work automatically rolls to the next cycle. Velocity tracking helps you see if you're overcommitting."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Linear good on mobile?",
      answer: "The iOS and Android apps exist and work well for checking status and triaging. But Linear really shines on desktop where you can use all the keyboard shortcuts. Mobile is fine for quick updates when you're away from your computer."
    }
  ],

  // ============================================
  // MIRO
  // ============================================
  "miro": [
    {
      question: "Is Miro free to use?",
      answer: "Yes, Miro offers a free plan with 3 editable boards, unlimited team members as viewers, and access to 1,000+ templates. Paid plans start at $8/member/month (Starter) for unlimited boards."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does Miro cost for teams?",
      answer: "Miro Starter costs $8/member/month, Business costs $16/member/month (adds SSO, advanced features), and Enterprise has custom pricing. Free viewers don't count toward your paid seats."
    },
    {
      question: "What can I use Miro for?",
      answer: "Miro is used for brainstorming, wireframing, retrospectives, mind mapping, user story mapping, strategic planning, workshops, and team collaboration. It's a digital whiteboard that works for both creative and structured work."
    },
    {
      question: "What integrations does Miro support?",
      answer: "Miro integrates with Slack, Microsoft Teams, Jira, Asana, Notion, Figma, Google Workspace, and 130+ other apps. It also offers Miro SDK for building custom integrations and apps."
    },
    {
      question: "Does Miro work offline?",
      answer: "Miro is primarily cloud-based and requires an internet connection for real-time collaboration. The desktop app provides some offline viewing capability, but editing requires connectivity."
    },
    {
      question: "Does Miro have video chat?",
      answer: "Yes, Miro includes built-in video chat, screen sharing, and collaboration tools. You can start video calls directly on boards, follow participants' cursors, and use timers and voting for workshops."
    },
    {
      question: "How does Miro compare to FigJam?",
      answer: "Miro is a dedicated whiteboard platform with more templates, frameworks, and structured features. FigJam is lighter and integrates better with Figma designs. Miro is better for complex workshops; FigJam is simpler for quick collaboration."
    }
  ],

  // ============================================
  // LOOM
  // ============================================
  "loom": [
    {
      question: "Is Loom free to use?",

      answer: "Loom integrates with Slack, Notion, Gmail, Salesforce, GitHub, Jira, and many other tools. You can embed Loom videos directly in most platforms, and the Chrome extension works anywhere."
    },
    {
      question: "Can viewers comment on Loom videos?",
      answer: "Yes, viewers can leave timestamped comments and emoji reactions on Loom videos. Creators get notifications for engagement. Comments make async communication more interactive and actionable."

      question: "Does Loom offer enterprise security?",
      answer: "Yes, Loom Enterprise includes SAML SSO, SCIM provisioning, advanced content controls, audit logs, and custom data retention. Loom is SOC 2 Type II certified and GDPR compliant."
